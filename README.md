The Virtual Standardized Patient (VSP) program is a mixed reality dentist-patient interaction mobile application. It was created by the UF MiDAS cohort for their Digital Arts and Sciences Convergence class in the fall semester of 2020. It utilizes ARCore for AR interactions, Google Cardboard for VR interactions, and the IBM Watson speech API for the patient's dialogue.

Two characters were made by Jordan Smith and  Aadithya Gowthaman, which were Logan and Paul, respectively. They are fully rigged models based off of Adobe Fuse models that we customized and retopoligized in Maya, then textured in Substance Painter.

## AR Scene

The AR scene is powered by ARCore, and allows the user to place the patient right in their living room! Simply open the scene and tap the place where you want the patient to be.

You can press the microphone button and read from the clipboard to converse with the patient, and make good decisions in your choices to deescalate the situation.

## VR Scene

The VR scene is powered by Google Cardboard, but can also be viewed without VR lens active in order to be more accessible.

Look at the clipboard and start reading from it to converse from the patient. The program will record your voice while you are looking at the clipboard, and the patient will reply when you are no longer looking at the clipboard.
