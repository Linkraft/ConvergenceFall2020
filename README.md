The Virtual Standardized Patient (VSP) program is a mixed reality dentist-patient interaction mobile application. It was created by the UF MiDAS cohort for their Digital Arts and Sciences Convergence class in the fall semester of 2020. It utilizes ARCore for AR interactions, Google Cardboard for VR interactions, and the IBM Watson speech API for the patient's dialogue.
